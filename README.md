This is ChadRobot.
This little robot got hurt and lost in a never-ending desert. With every step the robot takes, he looses a tiny bit of fuel.
But this robot is on a mission. His primary directive, you ask? Collect as many jewls. But most importantly, find a chest.

ChadRobot is a small java based game, with core featureas like an randomly generated map, an UI and more.
